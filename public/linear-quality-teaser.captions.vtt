00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.879
Okay, let's get started.

2
00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:07.519
So we just spent the last week and change talking to product builders across the industry who we

3
00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.359
think just build excellent products and who we think are really known for quality.

4
00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.359
It just the product works the way you work.

5
00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.120
Product management to some degree is an even more generalist version of design.

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.840
You have to create a great user experience because

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.920
that's the key to getting people to use your product.

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.319
Are there any common threads between these various builders at these various companies?

9
00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.360
Everything is a trade-off.

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.799
And it comes with all these trade-offs.

11
00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:29.600
That's a trade-off.

12
00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:36.240
We are just trying to answer the question of like how great quality products get built.

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.520
When I look at a new product, I'm like really looking for

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
the ones that are the most challenging to make.

15
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.880
A really clear vision for what this thing is.

16
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.479
Is it the most usable thing I can possibly have?

17
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.599
And why someone would buy it?

18
00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:49.599
Compelling features, incredible design.

19
00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:51.680
Is it the most valuable thing I can possibly have?

20
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.479
What are problems big enough for a particular group of people that they

21
00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.240
will cancel the rest of their day to solve?

22
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.520
The last one is craft.

23
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.319
Is it the best crafted thing that I can possibly experience?

24
00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.279
What's going to help you do it the fastest or help you kind of visualize

25
00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:05.199
something that wasn't available to you before?

26
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.000
As you sacrifice things, sacrifice anything,

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.800
but I'm responsible for what the product looks and feels like.

28
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:16.239
Actually, I hadn't thought about it that way.
